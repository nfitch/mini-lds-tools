Mini LDS Tools

The mini LDS tool consists of:

1. Command line tools for ingesting MLS exports and exporting comments.
1. A REST api for accessing information.
1. Simple UI for displaying information, adding comments and adjusting status.

The intent is a simplistic system for tracking those moving in and out of wards
and keeping personal notes about visits made, etc.

## Command-line tools

## Server and REST API

See [the REST api](docs/rest-api.md)

## Web App

If the interface isn't self-explanatory, then these tools are a failure.
